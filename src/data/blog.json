    "content": "# What is TOON?\n\n**TOON** (Typed Object Object Notation) is a minimalist data format that emerged in October 2025 as a game-changer for the AI era. Think of it as JSON's cleaner, more efficient cousin, designed for both humans and machines to read effortlessly.\n\n## The Problem with JSON\n\nJSON has dominated data interchange for years, and for good reason, it's structured and predictable. But here's the catch: it wasn't designed for readability or efficiency. It was built for JavaScript parsers.\n\nEvery JSON object is wrapped in curly braces, keys are quoted, commas are mandatory, and one misplaced character breaks everything. When you're working with deeply nested data or feeding information to LLMs, all that syntax becomes expensive noise.\n\n## How TOON Works\n\nTOON uses a CSV-inspired approach with a header declaration that defines the structure upfront. Instead of repeating keys for every object, you declare them once and provide just the values.\n\n**JSON looks like this:**\n```json\n{\n  \"customers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"name\": \"Immanuel Savio\",\n      \"email\": \"immanuel.savio@example.com\",\n      \"city\": \"Chicago\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"name\": \"Ritwik Sharma\",\n      \"email\": \"ritwik.sharma@example.com\",\n      \"city\": \"Toronto\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**TOON looks like this:**\n```\ncustomers[2]{id,name,email,city}:\n  1,Immanuel Savio,immanuel.savio@example.com,Chicago\n  2,Ritwik Sharma,ritwik.sharma@example.com,Toronto\n```\n\nSame information. A fraction of the noise.\n\n## The Token Economy\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. LLMs don't read characters, they read **tokens**. And every character in your data costs tokens.\n\nIn the example above, JSON requires repeating `\"id\":`, `\"name\":`, `\"email\":`, and `\"city\":` for every single record. TOON declares them once in the header: `{id,name,email,city}`.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- **Lower costs:** Fewer tokens = smaller API bills\n- **Faster responses:** Less syntax to generate\n- **More context:** Fit more actual data in the same window\n- **Better readability:** Data looks like a clean table, not nested chaos\n\nWhen you're working with large datasets or complex prompts, those savings add up fast.\n\n## Built for the AI Era\n\nTOON isn't just about efficiency, it's about clarity. Whether you're debugging a config file at 2 AM, optimizing a prompt for GPT-4, or processing thousands of records, TOON makes your data easier to work with.\n\nThe format is particularly powerful for:\n- Training data preparation\n- API responses with repeated structures\n- Configuration files\n- Data pipelines and transformations\n\n### Try it yourself\n\n[**🚀 Launch TOON Converter**](/playground/json-to-toon)"
